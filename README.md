This is a tour planning application which is developed using Angular2 and it pretty much allows the user to
1. Click on the map to add a waypoint 
2. Drag and adjust position of the waypoint 
3. Create a waypoint using the form 
4. Download the Selected waypoints in a JSON file 

The application has been built in such a way that waypoints are stored in the LocalStorage of the browser and hence they remain intact even when the page is refreshed. 

Here's the link to live demo of the application: https://youtu.be/3fzAPJDoxUk
